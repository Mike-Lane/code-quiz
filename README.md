Code Quiz

In this assignment I've been tasked with creating a timed code quiz that satifies the following conditions:
<ul>
    <li>has a start button</li>
    <li>has a clount-down timer</li>
    <li>questions are asked back-to-back</li>
    <li>incorrect answers are penalized (automatic 10 second penalization)</li>
    <li>When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, player can input initials and their scored is saved</li>
    <li>High scores are saved and ranked from best to worst</li>
</ul>
